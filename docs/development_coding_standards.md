- The [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008){:target="_blank"} style guide for **`Python`** code is strictly applied and enforced with static analysis tools.
- All program code must be commented with type hinting instructions.
- All public functions, modules and packages must be commented with **`Docstring`**.
- The program code must be covered as far as possible with appropriate tests - the aim is always 100 % test coverage.
- The successful execution of **`make final`** ensures that the program code meets the required standards.
