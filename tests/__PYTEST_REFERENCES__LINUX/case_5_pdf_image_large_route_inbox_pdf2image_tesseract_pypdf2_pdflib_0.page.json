Both the definitions of the preprocessing and of meaning are syntax-directed: rules are in correspondence with the productions of the EG and RG. The rationale for distinguishing the preprocessing from the meaning is that the meaning of an SQL subquery is, in general, rather difficult. Thus, we have determined a small set of subqueries which are representative of all other subqueries, and we have given the meaning just for them."
